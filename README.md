### Algorithm desciption
1. kalman filter to clean data of the sensor?
2. print position on plane and do a classification algorithm
    a. planes x, y, z are angles of the diretion movement vector
    b. derive position based on direction vector and acceleration
3. KNN algorithm to classify sensors based on position on plane
